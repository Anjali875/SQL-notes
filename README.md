# SQL-notes:
Database is a collection of related information (eg:phone book, todo list, shopping list, etc) which can be stored in diff. ways (on a computer, on paper, etc).
DBMS is a special software that helps users create and maintain a database. it handles large amounts of information, security, backups, importing-exporting data, etc.
CRUD represents the 4 main operations done with the database. they're create, read, update, delete.
2 types of databases: Relational Databases(SQL) and non-relational(Non-SQL)
relational databases organise data into one or more tables whereas, non-relational doenst use tables.
Relational: each table has rows and columns. Each table is related to other tables through keys
Non-relational: It is more flexible, handling unstructured or semi-structured data such as JSON, key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):
Help users create and maintain a relational database
mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc.
Structured Query Language (SQL):
Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
Used to to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administrative tasks (user management, security, backup, etc).
Used to define tables and structures
SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification.
